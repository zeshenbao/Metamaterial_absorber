# My plan for the project

## Project plan according to doc
1. Read about the science goals motivating current work in observational cosmology
2. Read a review article describing key aspects of telescopes studying the CMB
3. Read about mm-wave absorbers: 
4. Obtain familiarity and expand upon an open source Python code that generates geometries suitable for 3D printing
5. Learn how to use the Form 3 3D printer to print your custom shapes
6. Design resin needed for mm-wavelength absorption
7. Quantify density, material hardness, brittleness, and other easily-measurable material properties of candidate geometries and 3D printed resins
8. Measure surface resistivity of candidate materials at room temperature and 80-100 K 

## My own plan
1. Read some files
2. Look into Cadquery
3. Try to understand the code
4. Make your own design
