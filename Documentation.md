```  



### method init
```python
 def __init__(self, wall, pattern):
        """Creates an absorber object with input wall tiles and pattern.
        The start result is a empty cq.Workplane object in XY plane.

        ----------
        
        wall: wall object

```  


### method export
```python
def export(self):
        """Export the genereted cq.Workplane object stored as self.result to a stl file
