        Parameters
        ----------
        cross_section: str
            A textstring to select the type of cross section.

            Thickness of the tile foundation under the cross section.
            
        scale: float
            Scales with the given float to make tiles bigger or smaller.

        export: bool
            If set to True, make_wall_components() method will automatically call export_parts() method to export the wall parts to stl.
