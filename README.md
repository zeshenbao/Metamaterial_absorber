# Metamaterial_absorber

## Overview

This repo contains old code by other people and also [my own code](https://github.com/zeshenbao/Metamaterial_absorber/tree/main/current/own_code) which I wrote during my summer project.

Check out the [History_log.md](https://github.com/zeshenbao/Metamaterial_absorber/blob/main/History_log.md) for an overview of the project.

The most important files that I wrote during this summer:

1. Generate doglegged hilbert geometry
2. Generate doglegged grid geometry
3. Notes for cadquery
4. Work in progress code to extract VNA traces
5. VNA notes
6. Solid work parts for the static reflectometry system

## Installation
1. Install Python3
2. Install latest [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
3. Install [Cadquery2](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) on Miniconda
4. Create a [virtual enviroment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with conda
5. Run the code file in the venv.

## Getting started
1. Looking at cadquery [examples](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) could be useful.
2. Look in cadquery [class summary](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classreference.html#cadquery.Workplane) for details.
3. Test to make simple geometries and exporting to stl file.
